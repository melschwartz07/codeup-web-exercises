     * Create a function named `analyzeColor` that accepts a string that is a color
     * name as input. This function should return a message which relates to the
     * color stated in the argument of the function. For colors you do not have
     * responses written for, return a string stating so
     *
     * Example:
     *  > analyzeColor('blue') // returns "blue is the color of the sky"
     *  > analyzeColor('red') // returns "Strawberries are red"
     *
     *
     *  > analyzeColor('cyan') // returns "I don't know anything about cyan"
     *
     * You should use an if-else-if-else block to return different messages.
     *
     * Test your function by passing various string literals to it and
     * console.logging the function's return value
